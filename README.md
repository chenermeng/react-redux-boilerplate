# React Redux React-Router 4 Boilerplate

### :tada: React, React-Router 4, Redux and Webpack 2.

Just run `yarn install` and `yarn start`, then go to localhost:3000 to start developing.
To build, run `yarn run build`, and to preview run `yarn run preview`, then go
to localhost:1234 for the minified production bundle.

#### Async component loading
Components are now loaded async with react-router-loader and the store is injected via Redux Provider.
If you've downloaded this boilerplate before remember to run `yarn install` again.

### Todo

- [X] Async loading of components
- [X] Data fetching example
- [X] Protected Routes
